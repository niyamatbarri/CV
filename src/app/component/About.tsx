          <p>
          My educational journey began with matriculation from the Federal Board of 
          Intermediate and Secondary Education. I then pursued my intermediate studies
           in pre-engineering from the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education Abbottabad,
            where I developed a keen interest in mathematics. This led me to pursue a bachelors degree in 
            Mathematics from the University of Karachi,
           where I am currently enrolled.
